# App Allowlist Configuration

**Module:** Configuration
**Feature:** App Allowlist (Three-Tier)

---

## Purpose

Configurable application allowlist that defines which apps are permitted during work time. Follows the **hybrid permission model** — tenant sets defaults, roles can override, individual employees can have further overrides. Non-allowed app usage is logged and triggers exception alerts (NOT blocked).

## Three-Tier Model

```
Tenant Default (all employees)
  └── Role Override (per role — e.g., "Developer" gets IDE tools)
       └── Employee Override (per individual — e.g., John gets Figma)
```

**Resolution order (most specific wins per app name):**
1. Employee-level entry → use it
2. Role-level entry → use it
3. Tenant-level entry → use it
4. App not listed → depends on `allowlist_mode`:
   - `allowlist` mode: **not allowed** (flag it)
   - `blocklist` mode: **allowed** (only listed-as-blocked apps are flagged)

## Allowlist Modes

| Mode | Unlisted Apps | Use Case |
|:-----|:-------------|:---------|
| `allowlist` | Flagged as violation | Strict environments — only approved apps allowed |
| `blocklist` | Allowed | Permissive environments — only specific apps blocked |

Default: `allowlist` (configurable in `tenant_settings.settings_json`)

## Integration Points

### Agent Policy Distribution
When an admin changes the app allowlist, the resolved list for each affected employee is included in the agent policy:

```json
{
  "app_allowlist": {
    "mode": "allowlist",
    "apps": [
      { "name": "Microsoft Teams", "category": "communication", "is_allowed": true },
      { "name": "Visual Studio Code", "category": "development", "is_allowed": true }
    ],
    "alert_on_violation": true,
    "violation_threshold_minutes": 5
  }
}
```

The agent caches this allowlist locally. On policy change, agent-gateway sends `RefreshPolicy` command via SignalR.

### Activity Monitoring Integration
During activity data aggregation, each `app_usage` record is checked against the resolved allowlist. If an app is not allowed:
1. The usage is tagged with `is_allowed = false` in `application_usage` table
2. If cumulative non-allowed usage exceeds `violation_threshold_minutes`, a domain event is published
3. Exception engine evaluates and fires alert to reporting manager

### Exception Engine Integration
New rule type: `non_allowed_app_usage`

```json
{
  "rule_type": "non_allowed_app_usage",
  "threshold_json": {
    "max_minutes_per_day": 15,
    "max_consecutive_minutes": 5,
    "alert_severity": "medium"
  }
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Route | Permission | Description |
|:-------|:------|:-----------|:------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/settings/app-allowlist` | `monitoring:view-settings` | Tenant-level allowlist |
| POST | `/api/v1/settings/app-allowlist` | `monitoring:configure` | Add app to tenant list |
| PUT | `/api/v1/settings/app-allowlist/{id}` | `monitoring:configure` | Update entry |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/settings/app-allowlist/{id}` | `monitoring:configure` | Remove entry |
| GET | `/api/v1/settings/app-allowlist/role/{roleId}` | `monitoring:configure` | Role overrides |
| POST | `/api/v1/settings/app-allowlist/role/{roleId}` | `monitoring:configure` | Add role override |
| GET | `/api/v1/settings/app-allowlist/employee/{employeeId}` | `monitoring:configure` | Employee overrides |
| POST | `/api/v1/settings/app-allowlist/employee/{employeeId}` | `monitoring:configure` | Add employee override |
| GET | `/api/v1/settings/app-allowlist/resolved/{employeeId}` | `monitoring:view-settings` | Resolved (merged) list |

## Key Business Rules

1. **Non-allowed app usage is logged + alerted, NEVER blocked.** The system does not prevent employees from opening any application.
2. **Allowlist changes send `RefreshPolicy`** to all affected agents within 60 seconds.
3. **Role changes cascade.** If an employee's role changes, their resolved allowlist updates on next policy sync.
4. **Audit trail.** All allowlist changes are logged in `app_allowlist_audit` with who changed what and when.
5. **Categories are informational.** Category is for reporting grouping only — it doesn't affect allow/block logic.
6. **Case-insensitive matching.** App names matched case-insensitively (`chrome` = `Chrome` = `CHROME`).
